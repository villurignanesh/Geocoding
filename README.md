# Geocoding
In this I developed a project to read the data from Where.data and use google geo data by a python file geoload.py and developed a cleaned database geodata.sqlite which will be further used by python file geodump.py to convert the data into a representatable format i.e, Where.js.Now we can use this Where.js to develop Where.html where we can locate all the places in Where.data.To find any new place we can insert that data into Where.data.
